# Haskell Solutions

## Building
To compile the `haskell` solutions, you will need the Glasgow Haskell Compiler,
which is available here: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/.

It can also be installed via `brew` on Mac, by running `brew install ghc`.  To
compile the solutions, invoke `ghc` on the source files.

```
$ cd XXX
$ ghc *.hs
```
